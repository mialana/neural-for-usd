## Stage 1: General Preparation

- [x] 1. Decide which 3 neural rendering techniques to implement / models to utilize.

- [ ] 2. List necessary data to be collected from USD for each technique.

## Stage 1b: Implement basic neural rendering functions

- [] 1. NeRF

- [ ] 2. Gaussian Splatting

## Stage 2: Prepare for Data Collection

- [ ] 1. For each data element, research precedential collection methods for OpenUSD. Alternatively, experiment briefly with methods used for other file formats / DCCs.
- [ ] 2. Develop a database.

## Stage 3: Prepare for QT GUI and Python API creation

- [ ] 1. Design a QT-based GUI.
- Mark 3 features as essential for Milestone 1 demo.
- [ ] 2. Brainstorm desired endpoints for Python API. Begin creating pydantic models & fields.
- Mark 4 features as essential for Milestone 1 demo.

## Stage 4: Implement Data Collection

- [ ] 1. TODO
- [ ] 2. ...
   
#### Results:
- Python program with basic flags that will perform data collection on *a single* USD file.
  - Includes functionality to pipe into the database.

## Stage 5: Implement 3 endpoints of Python API

- [ ] 1. TODO
- [ ] 2. ...

## Stage 6: Implement 3 endpoints of QT GUI

- [ ] 1. TODO
- [ ] 2. ...

## Stage 7: Refinement

- [ ] 1. Refine flags for python program
- [ ] 2. TODO
- [ ] 3. ...
